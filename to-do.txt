while scraping i think the .textContent will also work instead of merging all <p> tags,
because if i select all text from a larger div i will get evry thing about the news,
 execpt the ads though,

reverse order button in collections, simply reverse the array using browser's js, then easily sort oldesr -> newest || new -> oldest


ok and only one bug in delete article, when deleting from left side, it says both article removed and article not found

<script>
      const collectionDisplay = document.querySelector(".collection_display");
      const collectionGroup = document.querySelectorAll(".collection_group");

      collectionGroup.forEach((group) => {
        group.addEventListener("click", () => {
          collectionDisplay.innerHTML = group.innerHTML;

          show_news_preview();
          read_in_new_tab();
          deleteArticle();

          // removing the dustbin from the collection_display,
          // at the first loading there will be error as Read Later does not have delete_collection / dustbin
          const collDisplay = document.querySelector('.collection_display');
          const deleteCollection =  collDisplay.querySelector('.delete_collection');
          deleteCollection.style.opacity = 0;
          --> always error ??????????//////////////????????/
        });
      });

      collectionGroup[0].click();
    </script>
