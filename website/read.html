                    /><br />On the night of November 8, after the FCI godown in
                    Hathras shut down for the weekend, a group of monkeys made
                    their way towards an open window in one of buildings where
                    grains are stored.<br /><br />The window was high, and to
                    get to it, the monkeys would have had to make their way over
                    a doorway, perch themselves on the parapet and then
                    manoeuvre through an open slot. According to officials, some
                    of the windows needed their screens replaced as the godown
                    was undergoing maintenance.<br /><br />At least 145 monkeys
                    never made it out of the building.<br /><br />On Friday,
                    veterinary doctors exhumed the bodies of five of the
                    monkeys, who were allegedly buried — surreptitious — and
                    conducted a postmortem.<br /><br />“The bodies were quite
                    putrefied, so we cannot say anything concrete right now.
                    They most likely died after inhaling poisonous gas, but
                    we’ve collected a few samples and sent them for testing… We
                    expect the results by Saturday,” said one of the doctors.<br /><br />The
                    godown had sacks containing wheat and rice, ready to be
                    shipped to distributors. The night before the godown’s staff
                    left for the weekend, as per routine, the stacks were
                    covered with tarpaulin and fumigated with an aluminium
                    phosphide solution. Officials suspect the monkeys died after
                    inhaling the gas from aluminium phosphide solution.<br /><br />On
                    the morning of November 11, labourers saw the bodies
                    scattered across the godown. Circle Officer Yogendra Krishna
                    Narayan said, “We suspect that the tarpaulin, which would
                    keep the gas inside, had a slit which allowed the gas to
                    escape into the room.”<br /><br />Police got to know about
                    the deaths after Bajrang Dal leader Harshit Gaur filed a
                    complaint, saying that on November 19, he received
                    information from his associate, an employee of the FCI
                    godown, that several monkeys were allegedly being buried
                    there.<br /><br />Gaur, Bajrang Dal’s Sah Vibhag Sangyojak
                    for Hathras and Mathura, said, “I spoke to an employee of
                    the FCI godown who suspected that the monkeys entered after
                    fumigation of the grains and died. He claimed that the
                    animals were buried inside with full Hindu rituals.”<br /><br />A
                    case was registered at Kotwali police station under BNS
                    sections 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive
                    substances) and 291 (continuance of nuisance after
                    injunction to discontinue). Additionally, provisions of the
                    Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act have been invoked.<br /><br />Additional
                    District Magistrate of Hathras, Shiv Narayan Sharma, said an
                    inquiry is underway.<br /><br />A police officer said, “We
                    asked them (godown employees) why they didn’t go to a
                    magistrate and inform him of the situation… We were told
                    that they were scared locals would be enraged because of the
                    deaths.”<br /><br />
