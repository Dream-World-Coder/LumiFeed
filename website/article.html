            Kiran Rao’s Laapataa Ladies was announced as India’s official entry to the 97th Academy Awards for the Best Foreign Film category. While the jury on social media is still divided about the
            choice, with many believing India’s best chance at the Oscars was robbed by not sending Payal Kapadia’s All We Imagine as Light, the actual jury that decided on Laapataa Ladies was headed
            by a legend of Indian cinema, director Jahnu Barua. The Assamese filmmaker lead the jury, which consisted of 12 other members. “All of us, who were part of the jury, were in it for the
            love of cinema,” says Jahnu Barua, in this exclusive conversation with us.&nbsp;

            Excerpts&nbsp;
            <br />
            How long did the deliberation take to arrive at a consensus?&nbsp;
            <br />
            We were in Chennai for 7-8 days, and we were watching the 29 films that were sent to us. Throughout this period, we used to have in-depth discussions about the films. Each and every jury
            member had strong opinions, and we kept the conversation going. We were in constant discussion about the films, studying it, shortlisting it, and finally coming up with one name. The final
            discussion to reach a consensus only took half a day or so because we were constantly in conversation about the films.&nbsp;
            <br />
            What was the deciding factor that tilted the scales in favour of Laapataa Ladies?
            <br />
            The jury has to look at the right film that represents India on all fronts. Particularly, the film has to represent India’s social systems and ethos. The Indianness is very important, and
            Laapataa Ladies scored on that front.&nbsp;
            <br />
            But does Indianness trump everything else? What if there was a better film that wasn’t that ‘Indian’?
            <br />
            It is important that the best suited film, which represents India, is sent as the official entry to the Oscars. There could be a better film outside the 29 films that were nominated too.
            But the jury can only choose from what they have been given, right?&nbsp;
            <br />
            29 is such a small number. Why are films not being pushed?&nbsp;
            <br />
            That is what we need to find a way out. We need to have a system in place to do justice to the kind of films coming from Indian cinema. Shouldn’t we be sending the best possible
            film?&nbsp;
            <br />
            Do you see a probability of Indian cinema constituting its own Oscars, and having a Best Foreign Film category?&nbsp;
            <br />
            It can happen, and efforts should be made. Being the country that makes the largerst number of films, it is only appropriate that India has a system like that in place.&nbsp;
            <br />
            How was the process of watching so many films for the Oscar nomination?&nbsp;
            <br />
            It was an exciting and passionate experience. It is something that doesn’t happen to everyone, and it made me very happy. Everyone who were part of jury were in it for the love of Indian
            cinema.&nbsp;

            At any point, did you feel the pressure of having this huge responsibility?
            <br />
            Not at all. Actually, everything depends on the jury members. We have to follow a strict kind of approach, and ensure no influence seeps in the selection process. Each of us has to apply
            our own mind and select the best. It also depends on the kind of leadership in a jury, and I never allowed any interference and influence in my jury.
